This is a skill for post processing serial number. If you want to add this skill to your own bot, simply clone this sample and start following the instructions here [Skill Template documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/botframework-solutions/skills/tutorials/create-skill/csharp/3-create-your-skill/) for resource provision, deployment and customization instructions. 
The core post processing logic is in the SpeechSerialNumber project, please see the SerialNumber.md for instruction on how to use it in your skill.
Right now, only English post processing with aggregation of input is fully supported, we're working hard to provide support for Spanish and French.
