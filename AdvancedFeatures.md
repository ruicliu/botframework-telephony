# Advanced features

While many bots can be Telephony-enabled by the steps above, you can build more effective bots by taking advantage of telephony and speech-specific capabilities as described below.

* [Process speech inside of the bot](ProcessSpeechInBotCode.md)
* [Transfer call to an agent](TransferCallOut.md)
* [Terminating a call](TerminateCall.md)
* [DTMF detection](DTMF.md)
* [Troubleshooting](TroubleshootingTelephonyBot.md)
* [Barge-in](BargeIn.md) (also known as *allow-interrupt*)
* [Call recording](CallRecording.md)

Telephony channel can be configured manually through the Azure portal or programmatically using [ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/resources) API or [Azure Command-Line Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure). 

Here are some example of configuring Telephony channel programmatically:

* [Configure Telephony channel using Azure CLI](az-cli-config.md)
* [List phone numbers bound to the bot](ListPhoneNumbers.md)
